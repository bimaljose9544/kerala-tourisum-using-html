            <strong> Kollam – The Land of Backwaters and Trade</strong>
                <div style="margin: auto;">
Kollam, also known by its historic name Quilon, is a coastal city in Kerala with a rich maritime history and natural beauty. Located in the southern part of the state, Kollam was once a major trade center for spices and cashew, with links to ancient Rome, China, and Arab countries. Today, it is known for its scenic backwaters, cultural heritage, and thriving cashew industry.

One of the major attractions of Kollam is the Ashtamudi Lake, which is the second-largest lake in Kerala and a gateway to the famous backwaters. Houseboat cruises through this lake offer a peaceful and picturesque experience for tourists. The city also serves as the starting point for the longest backwater cruise in Kerala, stretching up to Alappuzha.

Kollam has a unique blend of culture and history, with influences from Portuguese, Dutch, and British colonial periods. The Thangassery Light House, Kollam Beach, and Rameshwara Temple reflect this historical richness. The district is also home to several religious and cultural festivals, celebrated with great enthusiasm.

In addition to tourism, cashew processing plays a key role in Kollam's economy. It is often called the “Cashew Capital of the World”, exporting high-quality cashews to many countries.

Kollam’s serene environment, warm people, and cultural significance make it a wonderful destination to explore the beauty and diversity of Kerala.
