            <strong> Alappuzha – The Venice of the East</strong>
                <div style="margin: auto;">
Alappuzha, also known as Alleppey, is a picturesque district in the southern Indian state of Kerala, famous for its backwaters, beaches, and cultural heritage. Known as the “Venice of the East,” Alappuzha is interlaced with a network of canals, rivers, lagoons, and lakes, making it one of the most beautiful and unique places in India. The district was officially formed in 1957 and is located along the Arabian Sea coast. The region is rich in natural beauty and has a flat, low-lying geography ideal for inland waterways and rice farming. The famous Vembanad Lake, the longest lake in India, lies in Alappuzha and supports tourism, agriculture, and fishing. The district is also home to the Kuttanad region, often called the “Rice Bowl of Kerala,” where farming is done below sea level — a rare agricultural practice in the world. Alappuzha has a population of about 2.1 million (2011 Census) with a high literacy rate of over 96%. The people are known for their warm hospitality and strong cultural traditions, including performing arts like Kathakali and temple festivals. The economy mainly relies on coir industries, tourism, fishing, and farming. One of the district’s biggest attractions is the houseboat tourism through the scenic backwaters, offering visitors a peaceful experience surrounded by coconut palms, paddy fields, and traditional village life. The Nehru Trophy Boat Race, held annually on Punnamada Lake, draws thousands of spectators from around the world. Alappuzha town also has colonial-era architecture, including churches, lighthouses, and markets that reflect its history as a major trade port. The district is well-connected by road and rail, and the nearest airport is in Kochi. With its beautiful landscape, cultural vibrancy, and calm backwaters, Alappuzha is truly a gem of Kerala and a must-visit destination for travelers.
