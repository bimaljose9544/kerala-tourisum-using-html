    <h1>pepsi company</h1><br>
    PepsiCo's global headquarters are located in Purchase, New York, which is a hamlet within the town of Harrison in Westchester County. This has been their headquarters since 1970. Prior to that, PepsiCo was headquartered in Manhattan, New York City.It's interesting to note that the very first Pepsi-Cola was created in 1898 by pharmacist Caleb Bradham in New Bern, North Carolina. However, the company later relocated its headquarters to New York.
