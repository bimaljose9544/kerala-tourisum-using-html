            <strong> Pathanamthitta – The Pilgrim Capital of Kerala</strong>
                <div style="margin: auto;">
Pathanamthitta is a beautiful and culturally rich district located in the southern part of Kerala. Formed in 1982, it was carved out of the neighbouring districts of Alappuzha, Idukki, and Kollam. Often called the “Pilgrim Capital of Kerala,” it is most famous for the Sabarimala Temple, one of the largest pilgrimage centres in the world, which draws millions of devotees every year. The name Pathanamthitta is believed to have originated from the words "Pathanam" (cluster of houses) and "Thitta" (riverside), reflecting the region's landscape. The district covers an area of about 2,642 square kilometres, almost half of which is forest land. It lies at the foothills of the Western Ghats and is blessed with natural beauty, rivers, hills, and wildlife. The major rivers flowing through the district are the Pamba, Achankovil, and Manimala, which are essential for irrigation, drinking water, and electricity generation. According to the 2011 Census, Pathanamthitta has a population of around 1.19 million people. The district boasts a high literacy rate of nearly 97% and a sex ratio of 1,129 females for every 1,000 males. The main religions followed are Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam, with all communities living in harmony. Agriculture is the backbone of the economy, with rubber being the dominant crop, followed by coconut, pepper, banana, and tapioca. In recent years, farmers have also started growing exotic fruits like rambutan and dragon fruit. Pathanamthitta is also known for eco-tourism and scenic spots like Gavi, Konni Elephant Training Centre, and Perunthenaruvi Waterfalls. The Aranmula Boat Race and the unique Aranmula Kannadi (metal mirrors) are well-known across the state. Cultural traditions like Padayani, a folk dance performed in temples, keep the heritage of the region alive. The district is connected by good road networks, and the nearest railway stations are at Chengannur and Thiruvalla, with the nearest airport being Trivandrum International Airport. With its natural charm, religious significance, and cultural richness, Pathanamthitta is truly a gem of Kerala.
