            <strong> Thiruvananthapuram – The Capital of Kerala</strong>
                <div style="margin: auto;">
Thiruvananthapuram, formerly known as Trivandrum, is the capital city of Kerala and a vibrant blend of heritage, nature, and modernity. Located in the southern part of the state, it is a major center for administration, education, healthcare, and tourism. The city’s name is derived from the deity Anantha, referring to Lord Vishnu who reclines on the serpent Anantha in the famous Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple, one of the richest and most revered temples in the world.

Thiruvananthapuram is well known for its rich cultural history, with strong influences from art, architecture, and classical music. The city hosts important cultural institutions like Kerala Kalamandalam, Napier Museum, and Sri Chitra Art Gallery. It is also a major hub for film and literature, often hosting international film festivals and literary events.

In addition to its cultural importance, Thiruvananthapuram is also a technological hub. It is home to Technopark, India’s first and one of the largest IT parks, attracting companies and professionals from across the country.

The city is surrounded by natural beauty, with attractions like Kovalam Beach, Shankumugham Beach, Ponmudi hill station, and Neyyar Wildlife Sanctuary located nearby. These spots make the district a favorite among tourists.

With its mix of tradition and progress, spiritual centers and scientific institutions, Thiruvananthapuram offers a unique experience that reflects the essence of Kerala—peaceful, progressive, and culturally rich.
